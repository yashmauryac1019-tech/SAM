# 🏎️ Sam Dev – F1‑Inspired Portfolio (React Version)

A **single‑page React portfolio** inspired by Formula 1 design principles — speed, precision, and clean engineering.

This project demonstrates how core **frontend fundamentals** (state, props, component structure, animation logic) translate from vanilla HTML/CSS/JS into a modern **React architecture**.

---

## 🚦 Why This Project Exists

Most beginner portfolios look the same.

This one is intentionally different.

I built this to:

* Practice **React component thinking**
* Show **UI motion + interaction**, not just static pages
* Prove I understand **how things work**, not just how to copy libraries

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

* **React** (Functional Components)
* **CSS3** (no UI frameworks)
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **Git & GitHub**

No animation libraries. No UI kits.
Everything is built from first principles.

## 🧠 What This Shows Recruiters

* I understand **React state & re‑rendering**
* I can convert vanilla JS logic into React
* I care about **UX and interaction**, not just layout
* I don’t hide behind libraries

This is a **learning‑focused project**, and that’s intentional.

## 🏎️ Final Note

This project is not about being flashy.

It’s about **control, clarity, and growth** — exactly how real engineering works.
